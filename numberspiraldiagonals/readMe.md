Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

**__21__** 22 23 24 **__25__**  
20  **__07__**  08  **__09__** 10  
19  06  **__01__**  02 11  
18  **__05__**  04  **__03__** 12  
**__17__** 16 15 14 **__13__**  

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?




**__43__** 44 45 46 47 48 **__49__**   
42 **__21__** 22 23 24 **__25__**  26  
41 20  **__07__**  08  **__09__** 10 27   
40 19  06  **__01__**  02 11  28  
39 18  **__05__**  04  **__03__** 12 29  
38 **__17__** 16 15 14 **__13__**  30  
**__37__** 36 35 34 33 32 **__31__**
