Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

1: Rechts, Rechts, runter, runter
2: Rechts, runter, Rechts, runter
3: Rechts, runter, runter, Rechts
4: runter, Rechts, Rechts, runter
5: runter, Rechts, runter, Rechts
6: runter, Runter, rechts, rechts

How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?
